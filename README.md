## What is it?
Like it the title says. It shows a notification when the battery is low. Plus it plays a nice beep bios sounds when showing the notifications.

## How can I install it?
1: Make sure you have a notification daemon (dunst for example) and beep installed. Otherwhise it won't work. And check if the beep bios sounds is enabled from bios and is unmuted from alsamixer.
